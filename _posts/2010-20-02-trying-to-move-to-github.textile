It's been a while since I've last blogged. Now I'm trying to find a good place for my blog.
After many tries (cloud.io on Heroku, posterous, self hosted, godaddy, self hosted, wordpress, blogspot) that didn't work from different reasons, I've decided to try Github.
I'm curious how is this torment of mine going to end.
